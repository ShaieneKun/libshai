# libshai

## Introduction

libshai is a "expanded" blog. It has (or aims to) different projects alongside
simple articles.

It's created by software developers and artists, and we want to express the best of both worlds here. Hopefully you will find something fun or interesting here!

## Setup

libshai likes containers, so `podman` or `docker` are our tools

Install your preferred one and run

```
podman-compose up
```
or
```
docker-compose up
```

You should be good to go, on [localhost at port 3000](http://localhost:8000)
